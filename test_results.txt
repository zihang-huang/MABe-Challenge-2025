Model Evaluation Summary:
1. The model (TCN) was loaded from 'tcn_mouse_behavior.pth'.
2. Inference was run on specific targeted examples known to contain positive behaviors (attack, follow, mount, shepherd, sniff).
3. The model consistently predicted 0.00 probability for all classes.
4. Investigation revealed that the input features are unnormalized and have very large magnitudes (e.g., range -90,000 to +70,000).
5. The model outputs extremely negative logits (e.g., -50 to -1000), resulting in sigmoid probabilities of 0.
6. Conclusion: The model failed to learn effective categorization, likely due to the lack of feature normalization (StandardScaler or similar) in the training pipeline. The training loss decreased likely because the model learned to predict the majority class (No Behavior) by suppressing all activations.

Recommendations:
- Implement feature normalization (e.g., sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler) in the preprocessing pipeline or the Dataset class.
- Re-train the model with normalized data.
