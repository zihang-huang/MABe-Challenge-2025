Pseudo-Labeling (Semi-Supervised)
  If you have a lot of unlabelled data, you can use the model to teach itself.

   * How it works:
       1. Train the model on the small set of labelled data.
       2. Run the model on the unlabelled segments.
       3. If the model is very confident (e.g., > 95% probability) about a prediction, treat that prediction as a "ground truth"
          label.
       4. Retrain the model using both the real labels and these new "pseudo-labels."
